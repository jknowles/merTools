Description: Provides methods for extracting results from mixed-effect model
    objects fit with the 'lme4' package. Allows construction of prediction intervals
    efficiently from large scale linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models.
    This method draws from the simulation framework used in the Gelman and Hill (2007) textbook:
    Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.0.2),
    arm,
    lme4 (>= 1.1-11),
