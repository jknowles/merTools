# Marginalizing Random Effects

One of the most common questions about multilevel models is how much influence grouping terms have
on the outcome. One way to explore this is to simulate the predicted values of an observation
across the distribution of random effects for a specific grouping variable and term. This can
be described as "marginalizing" predictions over the distribution of random effects. This allows
you to explore the influence of the grouping term and grouping levels on the outcome scale by
simulating predictions for simulated values of each observation across the distribution of
effect sizes.

The `REmargins()` function allows you to do this. Here, we take the example `sleepstudy` model and
marginalize predictions for all of the random effect terms (Subject:Intercept, Subject:Days). By
default, the function will marginalize over the *quartiles* of the expected rank (see expected
rank vignette) of the effect distribution for each term.

```{r}
fm1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
mfx <- REmargins(merMod = fm1, newdata = sleepstudy[1:10,])
head(mfx)
```

The new data frame output from `REmargins` contains a lot of information. The first few columns
contain the original data passed to `newdata`. Each observation in `newdata` is identified by a
`case` number, because the function repeats each observation by the number of random effect terms
and number of breaks to simulate each term over. Then the `grouping_var`


# Summarizing




# Plotting

Finally - you can plot the results marginalization to evaluate the effect of the random effect terms
graphically.

```{r mfxplot1}
ggplot(mfx) + aes(x = breaks, y = fit_Subject, group = case) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~term)

```
